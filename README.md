# A nice utility for various maps browsing and VATSIM network tracking. 
Note that it is still under heavy "work in progress" and the final release will look different from what it is today.
&nbsp;
### Planned features are: 
- Full multiple map provider optioned map browsing
- User-friendly interface
- Lightweight, easily readable and fast code
- Connection to VATSIM's network and ablility to look though it
- More user-adapted UI than this from [VATSIM's Map](https://map.vatsim.net)
- Making the user's like easier by applying loading screens that show only when necessary, albo by avoid blank spaces and reducing overwhelming unreadable text.

#### This project needs some time to be done but the final effect should be worth it :)
